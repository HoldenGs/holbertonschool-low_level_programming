The Monty Bytecode Interpreter

This program interprets Monty Bytecode. Monty is a programming language
built by Julien Barbier.

The interpreter will work for the following commands:
push
pall
pint
pop
swap
add
nop
sub
div
mul
mod
#
pchar
pstr
rotl
rotr
stack
queue

If there is an error, the interpreter fails and prints out the line and error.

This project was built in C by Holden Grissett and Ntuj Vang.
